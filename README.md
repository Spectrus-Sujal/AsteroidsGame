# AsteroidsGame

## Description 
A recreation of the classic Asteroids game using JavaScript based on the P5JS library.

###Purpose
This project was made for my Applied Math class in which I had to implement several features to get marks, The standout feature of this game that I added is the
navigation used by the small saucers as they will try and doge asteroids by using 1 of 4 thrusters each located in the corners of the saucer.
